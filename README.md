This mod does two things:

- Allows glass and glass panes to be rendered using translucent textures. Attempting to do this using only a resource pack does not work because translucent blocks are rendered during a separate stage.
- Provides a built-in resource pack which reduces the opacity of glass and glass panes.

Some additional notes:

- You have to enable the built-in resource pack (or an external one that is compatible) in order for this mod to have any effect.
- This mod requires the Fabric API, specifically the rendering API. This also means that if you're using it with Sodium, Indium is required.
- The built-in resource pack includes CTM textures, so it will work with Continuity.
