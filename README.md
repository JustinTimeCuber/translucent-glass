# Translucent Glass Mod

by JustinTimeCuber

This mod does two things:

- Allows glass and glass panes to be rendered using translucent textures. Attempting to do this using only a resource pack does not work because translucent blocks are rendered during a separate stage.
- Provides a built-in resource pack which reduces the opacity of glass and glass panes.
